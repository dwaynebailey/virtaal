"""The abstract form of a string: each placeable replaced by one marker
character for its class, and an accelerator removed, so that strings
differing only in placeables or accelerator style match.

Translation memory scores matches on the abstract form and rebuilds a
match's target with the current unit's own placeables and accelerator.
The raw text is always kept; an abstract is never turned back into text.

This module needs only translate-toolkit and the standard library, so the
local TM server process (and amaGama, from a copy) can use it.
